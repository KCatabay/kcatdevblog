So I decided to use some of my new JS knowledge to create a 'Mad Libs' inspired story generator.

http://kcatabay.github.io/story-time/

Treehouse's basic JS course had a segment that instructed the user to create their own story generator using strings and simple concatenation.  If you check the code on GitHub, you can see that I used the shorthand '+=' to add the strings together. This probably isn't 'best practice', but it is a start.  

All in all this was a fun little project and allowed me to practice HTML, CSS, and JS in addition to letting me get more experience with GitHub. I had a lot of fun and I'll be doing more JS related stuff in the future (think i'm going to make a pizza topping generator or something like that)!
